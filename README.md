## 💼 What is the CS2 SkinChanger?

SkinChanger is a cosmetic mod tool that **injects custom skins directly into your CS2 game** client. Unlike marketplaces or loot cases, this doesn’t touch your Steam inventory – it's visual only, meaning you see the skin, your teammates may not (depending on server), but the flex? Still elite.

Whether you're into **butterfly knives, custom gloves, rare AKs, or AWP dragon skins**, this cheat gives you full access, no RNG, no gambling.
